    This section describes the use of the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rever <new_version_number>

    which takes complete care of releasing new versions to be merged onto the
    main git branch.

This section describes the bookkeeping required in maintaining a changelog
with a Tudat repository. The system is simple, and only requires a consistent
approach and a decent understanding of ``Rever``. The result is a well kept
changelog, providing traceability in development.
