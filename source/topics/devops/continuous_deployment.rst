The previous section described the concepts that found the creation of a Conda
package. This section will describe how packages are built, tested and
deployed using an open source continuous deployment (CD) system built by

.. note:: ``conda-smithy`` can also be used as a continuous integration (CI)
        and continuous delivery system.
