Code Collaboration
==================

This section describes the use of Git and Github in relation to standard
Tudat developer use cases. This chapter does not serve as a complete tutorial
on Git, but rather as common practices with fundamentals of the Git
workflow (or Gitflow) used by the Tudat Team.

.. note::
        Git comes with the Anaconda and Miniconda
        distributions by default. If you are using Conda, then Git is already
        available in your Conda command-line interface (specific to your OS).

Develop and Master Branches
---------------------------

Instead of a single ``master`` branch, this workflow uses two branches to record
the history of the project. The ``master`` branch stores the official release
history, and the ``develop`` branch serves as an integration branch for features.
It's also convenient to tag all commits in the ``master`` branch with a version
number. :cite:p:`atlassian-gitflow`

    :file: graphics/gitflow1.svg

The first step is to complement the default ``master`` with a ``develop`` branch. A
simple way to do this is for one developer to create an empty ``develop`` branch
locally and push it to the server (remote):

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch develop
    git push -u origin develop

Existing ``develop`` on remote
******************************

It may be the case that a ``develop`` branch already exists on the remote. To
see all remote branches:

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch -r

If the newly created local ``develop`` branch (copied from ``master``) is
even with the remote ``develop``, then pushing the local ``develop`` branch
will result in no hitch. However, if there are differences, it may be that
development is already ongoing, and ``develop`` is ahead of ``master``. In this
case, it would be preferable to switch to the remote ``develop``:

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch origin develop

    :fa:`terminal` **Try it yourself!**

    ^^^

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git branch -r
        origin/HEAD -> origin/main
        origin/main

    You can think of the ``HEAD`` as the "current branch". The output above shows
    that there aren't any ``develop`` branches available on the remote. Let's
    create one:



.. note::

        Command variants for checking available branches and their
        descriptions:

        +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
        | **Variant**       | **Description**                      |
        +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
        | ``git branch``    | To see local branches                |
        +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
        | ``git branch -r`` | To see remote branches               |
        +-------------------+--------------------------------------+
        | ``git branch -a`` | To see all local and remote branches |
        +-------------------+--------------------------------------+




Feature Branches
----------------

Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the
central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of
master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is
complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact
directly with master. :cite:p:`atlassian-gitflow`

Note that feature branches combined with the develop branch is, for all intents
and purposes, the Feature Branch Workflow. But, the Gitflow Workflow doesnâ€™t
stop there. Feature branches are generally created off to the latest develop
branch.

Creating a feature branch
*************************

.. tabbed:: Standard ``git``

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git checkout develop
        $ git checkout -b feature_branch

.. tabbed:: With ``git-flow`` extension

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git flow feature start feature_branch

Release Branches
